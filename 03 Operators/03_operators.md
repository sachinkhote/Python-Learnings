# Chapter: Python Operators

This chapter covers operators, which are tools in programming that allow you to perform actions like adding numbers, comparing values, or assigning values to variables. Operators are utilized for executing operations on both variables and values.

## Types of Operators

There are 7 main types of operators in Python:
1.  Arithmetic Operators
2.  Comparison Operators
3.  Logical Operators
4.  Bitwise Operators
5.  Assignment Operators
6.  Membership Operators
7.  Identity Operators

## Arithmetic Operators

These operators are used for mathematical calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus (remainder), and exponentiation.

* **`+` (Addition)**: Combines two numbers together to give a total.
* **`-` (Subtraction)**: Takes one number away from another to find the difference.
* **`*` (Multiplication)**: Multiplies two operands.
* **`/` (Division)**: Divides the numerator by the denominator.
* **`%` (Modulus)**: Returns the remainder after dividing one number by another.
* **`**` (Exponentiation)**: Raises a number to a power (e.g., multiplying a number by itself a certain number of times).
* **`//` (Floor Division)**: Divides and rounds **down** to the nearest whole number, discarding any remainder.

```python
x = 10
y = 3

print(x + y)   # Output: 13
print(x - y)   # Output: 7
print(x * y)   # Output: 30
print(x / y)   # Output: 3.333...
print(x % y)   # Output: 1
print(x ** y)  # Output: 1000
print(x // y)  # Output: 3
